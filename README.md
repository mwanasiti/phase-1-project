# phase-1-project

## Project goals
Design and architect features across a frontend
Communicate and collaborate in a technical environment
Integrate JavaScript and an external API
Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects
Build and iterate on a project MVP

## Project requirements
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

## Guidelines
Describe/sketch your ideas (use diagrams!).
Start by creating a frontend directory with the basic files you'll need
Next, build enough code to get some API data to work with. Don't worry about building all of your async code yet, just get to the point where you can access one endpoint on an API, then start working on getting that data displayed.
Then, continue to build additional async code and frontend features.
Continue building features one by one.


## Project Name
TO DIE FOR RESTAURANTS.

## Author
Ali Mariam

## Project Description
Problem Statement:
Many a times, finding a good restaurant proves to be quite a hustle for a majority. From deciding and planning for the exact location to the choice of food. Some of the challenges one may face include lack of knowledge on where the restaurants are located hence the inability to plan properly for transportation. Another challenge would be the lack of knowledge on the food offered in specific restaurants. 

Solution statement:
Creation of a platform that enables access to all the aforementioned details. Furthermore, providing the ability to access information about different restaurants from the same website and being being able to compare without having to shift from website to website. This would also help in the inclusion of restaurants that do not easily show up in the search engine thereby enabling one to have a broad range to choose from.
